In today’s competitive market, data analysis plays an important role in understanding customer behavior and improving business performance. This Bike Sales Data Analysis project focuses on analyzing bike sales data using Microsoft Excel to extract meaningful insights and support better decision-making.
The Bike Sales Data Analysis project is designed to analyze customer data and understand the factors that influence bike purchasing behavior. The dataset contains customer details such as age, gender, marital status, income, education, occupation, commute distance, region, and bike purchase status (Yes/No).

These charts visually represent key insights like average income by purchase status, bike purchases by age group, gender, occupation, and region. Visual representation helps in quickly identifying trends and comparisons.
All pivot tables and charts are combined into an interactive Excel dashboard. The dashboard provides a consolidated view of bike sales performance and allows users to filter data using slicers.
